# Unsupervised Learning

Can we make sense of data without a target variable? 

--

- **Yes**, at least to some extent. Although our focus would shift to finding the underlying structure of the input data instead of function between input and output like in supervised learning.

--

- Examples include:
  -  Clustering (e.g., K-Means)
  -  Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)

# Clustering


---

# <span style="font-size: 35px;">Clustering</span>


Partitioning data into groups called clusters based on their similarities.

--

- The goal is to discover underlying groups/patterns in a given dataset such that:

--

    - data in the same group are as similar as possible.

    - data in different groups are as different as possible.

K-Means is among the most widely used algorithms for clustering data

- **Output**

  - $k$ clusters of the data points

# K-Means algorithm


In K-Means clustering, the objective is to represent each cluster by its centroid and assign each data point to a cluster. 

--

But this is a bit complex in reality:

--
  - **Assigning Data Points**: If the cluster centers were known, each data point could be assigned to the nearest center.
  
--

  - **Determining Cluster Centers**: Conversely, if the cluster assignments were known, the centers could be computed as the mean of the assigned points.


--

The problem, however, is we neither know the cluster centers nor the assignments(a priori). 

--

So, how do we resolve that? 

--

_**Iterative approach**_



---

#KMeans algorithm

Recall, 

**Input**: our data points (X) and the number of clusters (K)

**Initialization**: Randomly select initial cluster centers.

**Iterative process**:

  - **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster center.
  - **Update Step**: Recalculate the cluster centers as the mean of the assigned points.
  - **Convergence Check**: Repeat the above steps until the assignments no longer change or maximum iterations reached.


---

#Example

So, Let’s execute K-Means algorithm on our simulated data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# Determine the number of examples (rows) in X
n_examples <- nrow(X)
cat("Number of examples:", n_examples, "\n")

# Display the data matrix X
X[1:10,]

# Set the number of clusters
k <- 3



```

Recall, that $k = 3$


---

#Initialization

.center[
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

set.seed(999)

centers_idx <- sample(1:n_examples, size = k, replace = FALSE)
centers_it <- X[centers_idx, ]


# Convert data to a data frame for ggplot
df_it <- as.data.frame(X)
colnames(df_it) <- c("Feature1", "Feature2")

# Convert centers to a data frame
centers_df_it <- as.data.frame(centers_it)
colnames(centers_df_it) <- c("Feature1", "Feature2")

# Plot data points and initial cluster centers
ggplot(df_it, aes(x = Feature1, y = Feature2)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", size = 2) +  # Data points
  geom_point(data = centers_df_it, aes(x = Feature1, y = Feature2), color = "red", size = 4, shape = 8) +  # Initial centers
  labs(title = "Data Points with Initial Cluster Centers",
       x = "Feature 1",
       y = "Feature 2") +
  theme_minimal()



```
]


---

#Next: Iterative process

repeat


  - **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster center.
  
  - **Update Step**: Recalculate the cluster centers as the mean of the assigned points.
  
  - **Convergence Check**: repeat the steps untill the assignments no longer change
  




---

#How do we find closest centers?

- First step is to assign examples to the closest center.

- We can consider distance of data to all centers and assign that to the closest center.


--

Let's see this example.

[**Closest Centers Example**](https://hammed.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/)




---
#Finding Closest Centers

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# calculate distances and update cluster assignments
update_Z <- function(X, centers) {
  X <- as.matrix(X)
  centers <- as.matrix(centers)
  
  # Number of data points and centers
  n_points <- nrow(X)
  n_centers <- nrow(centers)
  
  # Initialize a matrix to store distances
  dist_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = n_points, ncol = n_centers)
  
  # Calculate Euclidean distances
  for (i in 1:n_points) {
    for (j in 1:n_centers) {
      dist_matrix[i, j] <- sqrt(sum((X[i, ] - centers[j, ])^2))
    }
  }
  
  # nearest center for each point
  cluster_assignments <- apply(dist_matrix, 1, which.min)
  
  return(list(distances = dist_matrix, assignments = cluster_assignments))
}



```


---

#Update centers

- Now that we have new cluster assignments, we need to update cluster centers.

--

- New cluster centers are means of data points in each cluster.

--

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

update_centers <- function(X, Z, old_centers, k) {
  # Initialize new centers
  new_centers <- old_centers
  
  # Iterate over each cluster
  for (kk in 1:k) {
    # Identify the indices of data points assigned to cluster kk
    cluster_indices <- which(Z == kk)
    
    # Calculate the mean of these data points to update the cluster center
    if (length(cluster_indices) > 0) {
      new_centers[kk, ] <- colMeans(X[cluster_indices, , drop = FALSE])
    } else {
      # If a cluster has no points assigned, retain the old center
      new_centers[kk, ] <- old_centers[kk, ]
    }
  }
  
  return(new_centers)
}


```



---

#Putting Together


- Initialize

--

- Iteratively alternate between the following two steps.

--

  - Assignments update  $z$ -> we assign each data to the closest center
    
--
  
  - Center Update -> we estimate new centers as average of data in a cluster


---

#Iterations

[**Iterations Example**](https://hammed.shinyapps.io/iteration_app/)



---

#KMeans: When do we stop?

--

- When the centroids are no longer changing

--

- That indicates KMeans convergence, thus we stop!

--

- KMeans will eventually converge, but doesn't necessarily mean it find the "*right*" clusters. It can converge to local optima - the final clusters depend on the starting positions of the centroids.




---
#<span style="font-size: 35px;">Initialization of K-Means is stochastic</span>

--

- Because the initial cluster centers are selected randomly

--

- This means that if you run the K-Means multiple times with different random initializations, you might get **different clustering results**.

--

----

*<span style="font-size: 30px;">Initialization is Important</span>*

--

- K-Means can converge to local optima — the final clusters depend on the starting positions of the centroids.

--

- Poor initialization can lead to:

  - Slow convergence.

--

  - Incorrect clustering.

--

  - Higher final inertia (sum of squared distances from points to cluster centers will be larger).
  
  
  
  
---
class: inverse, center, middle

#How do we decide the value of K?

---

#Hyperparameter Optimization

--

- The number of clusters must be defined before running K-Means.

--

-  For example, in supervised learning, hyperparameter tuning can be done by cross-validation.

--

- However, In unsupervised learning, since we don't have target values, it's harder to evaluate the algorithm’s performance objectively.

--

- There’s no single perfect method for choosing the optimal number of clusters.

--

- However, there are several strategies that can help estimate a suitable value for K.



---

#The Elbow method

--

- This method evaluates the total sum of distances within each cluster, known as inertia

--

- Inertia represents the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned cluster center.


--

- the intra-cluster distance can be expressed as:

$$\sum_{P_i \in C_1} \text{distance}(P_i, C_1)^2 + \sum_{P_i \in C_2} \text{distance}(P_i, C_2)^2 + \sum_{P_i \in C_3} \text{distance}(P_i, C_3)^2$$



---

#Inertia

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# Generate synthetic data (equivalent to make_blobs)
set.seed(10)
n_samples <- 100
n_features <- 2
n_centers <- 3

# Create random cluster centers and generate data
centers <- matrix(runif(n_centers * n_features, min = -10, max = 10), ncol = n_features)
X_in <- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:n_centers, function(i) {
  matrix(rnorm(n_samples * n_features, mean = centers[i, ], sd = 1), ncol = n_features)
}))

# Plot the data points
df_in <- data.frame(X1 = X_in[, 1], X2 = X_in[, 2])


ggplot(df_in, aes(x = X1, y = X2)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Data (3 Clusters)") +
  theme_minimal()

```


---

#Inertia

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Function to calculate inertia for different values of K
calculate_inertia <- function(X_in, max_k) {
  inertia_values <- numeric(max_k)
  for (k in 1:max_k) {
    model <- kmeans(X_in, centers = k, nstart = 10)
    inertia_values[k] <- sum(model$withinss)  # Inertia = sum of within-cluster sum of squares
  }
  df_int <- data.frame(K = 1:max_k, Inertia = inertia_values)
  return(df_int)
}



```


---

#Inertia

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Generate inertia values for K = 1 to 10
inertia_df <- calculate_inertia(X_in, 10)

print(inertia_df)

```


--

- From the above table, as $k$ increases, *inertia* decreases




---

#*<span style="font-size: 30px;">So, should the inertia be small or very large?</span>*

--

- Actually, the goal is not to just look for a $k$ that minimizes inertia since it decreases as $k$ increases.

--

For example:

  - If we have number of $k =$ number of data points, each data will have its own cluster and then intra-cluster distance will $= 0$.
  
--
  
  - So, trade-off is necessary here: i.e., we need small $k$ vs small intra-cluster distances.

.pull-right[


  - The plot suggests that three clusters should be okay, as indicated by the inflection point on the curve.



  - Although inertia decreases with more than three clusters, the improvement is minimal, so $K = 3$ is a reasonable choice.



  - In our example here, the plot is straightforward to interpret, but it can be challenging in real-world scenarios.

#Silhouette method

--

- Does not rely on the concept of cluster centroids.

--

- Computed using two metrics for each data point:

--

  - The mean distance to all other points within the same cluster (a).

--

  - The mean distance to all points in the nearest neighboring cluster (b).


---

#Mean intra-cluster distance (a)

--

- For a given sample (e.g., the green point here), calculate the average distance to all other points within the same cluster.

--

- These distances are depicted by black lines connecting the sample to other points in its cluster.

- The average distance from the green point to the blue points is smaller than to the red points, making the blue cluster the **closest**.



- Thus, the mean nearest-cluster distance $=$ average distance between the green point and the blue points.

]



---

#Silhouette Score for samples
--

- The silhouette distance for a sample is the difference between the mean nearest-cluster distance (b) and the mean intra-cluster distance (a), normalized by the maximum of the two values:

--

i.e.,

$$S = \frac{b - a}{max(a, b)}$$


--

- It ranges from $-1$ to $1$ (worst to best values) with values near $0$ means we have many overlapping clusters.

- Thus, the overall Silhouette score is the average Silhouette scores for all samples.

#<span style="font-size: 35px;">Interpretation of Silhouette Plots</span>

--

- Silhouette Values:

  - Higher silhouette values indicate that a data point is close to its own cluster and far from neighboring clusters, suggesting well-separated clusters.
  

--

- Cluster Size Representation:

  - The width of each silhouette reflects the number of data points in the cluster, providing insight into cluster sizes.
  

--

- Cluster Quality:

  - The shape and length of each silhouette $=$ the quality of the clustering; a more rectangular shape with a slower drop-off indicates that more points are appropriately clustered.

#<span style="font-size: 35px;">Recap and Key Takeaways</span>

--

- The silhouette method can be applied to evaluate the results of different clustering algorithms beyond **K-Means**.
  
  
--

- Remeber, Clustering is an **unsupervised** learning.

--

- **Distance Metrics**: While not extensively covered here, the choice of distance metrics is a crucial factor in clustering, as it influences how similarity between data points is measured.

---
#<span style="font-size: 35px;">Recap and Key Takeaways</span>

--

- K-Means requires specifying the number of clusters $(k)$ in advance.
  
--

- Assigns each data point exclusively to one cluster.
  
--

- The cluster labels generated are arbitrary and no specific meaning.
  
--

- Cluster centroids are computed as the mean of data points within a cluster
  
--

- KMeans always converge: however, that may be suboptimal as it's influenced by the initial centroids.

--

- **Elbow and Silhouette** techniques are commonly used to assess the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset.


--

- *Applications*: Data exploration, feature engineering, customer segmentation, and document clustering.
      
--
- *Interpreting* the results of clustering algorithms often requires manual effort and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights
